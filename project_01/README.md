# Capstone Project Plan

## Overview
My Web Application is going to be a Beauty App that allows a user to look up a product that shows them if it is healthy. This includes information like whether a product is gluten-free, non-gmo, or natural, etc... This idea came from me and most of the women in my family having a gluten intolerance.

## Features
Reviews: Users can leave a review on each individual product.

Search Filter: Users can search and filter products by brand, type, and tag.

Custom Post Types: Allows Admin to update products easily as a Wordpress post type.

## Technologies
Wordpress: Includes PHP and Javascript
Sage: Wordpress starter Theme
MySQL
Getting starting data from http://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/

## What I'll Have to Learn
I will be using a public API. I will need to figure out how to take that JSON data and run it through a script that will post the data into my database. I will be having to build on top of my starter theme with PHP and Javascript which I will have to learn along the way.
