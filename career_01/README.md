<h3>Description of Meetup</h3>
<p>We discussed a new up and coming wordpress editor called Gutenber which is named after Johannes Gutenberg who invented the printing press. This specific editor is great for beginners like myself by utilizing shortcodes and html instead of having just a regular text editor.</p>

<h3>Questions</h3>
<ul> 
    <li>Question 1) What is the story behind this new editor?
       <ul>
            <li>
            Answer 1) The creator of this editor wants to move the wordpress ecosystem forward. The community for a long time has been frustrated with the way wordpress is able to publish and customize its content, so this editor is trying to push those wants and needs forward for those who already make a living doing wordpress while also trying to create something that will be used by future wordpress devs.
            </li>
       </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Question 2) When will this editor be available to use?
       <ul>
            <li>
            Answer 2) It is already in beta testing as a plugin, they are hoping to release the full editor by wordpress version 5.0. For beta, anyone can use it and they encourage a lot of feedback.
            </li>
       </ul>
    </li>
     <li>Question 3) What are some negatives about this editor?
       <ul>
            <li>
            Answer 3) Some answers: UI is clunky where some small tasks take a few more clicks to initiate. Shortcodes can only be placed in shortcode blocks, not in paragraphs. You can't wrap text around an image, you have to use a block.
